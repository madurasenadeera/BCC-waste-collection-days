The Household’s General Waste will be picked up every WEDNESDAY and

IF the current week is designated as an EVEN week (in WASTE_COLLECTION_WEEKS_REFERENCE_TABLE dataset)

	THEN

	The Household’s Recycled Waste will be picked up that week

ELSE
	The Household’s Green Waste will be picked up that week

ENDIF

ENDIF

	THEN

	The Household’s Recycled Waste will be picked up that week
